🤔 Why Debian?
A: Debian was my go-to choice due to its ease of installation and configuration, especially compared to CentOS, which I hadn't used before.

🧠 What's a Virtual Machine (VM)?
A: A VM is a virtualized compute resource that runs software instead of a physical computer, allowing different operating systems to function independently on the same host.

🚀 Purpose of VMs?
A: VMs serve various purposes, from accommodating different processing power needs to running software requiring a different OS, or providing a safe environment for application testing.

💻 How do VMs work?
A: VMs leverage virtualization technology, simulating virtual hardware through software, enabling them to run on a single host machine.

🔄 aptitude vs. apt?
A: Aptitude is a high-level package manager, while apt is a lower-level package manager usable by other higher-level package managers. Read more

🔒 What is AppArmor?
