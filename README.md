# Hello, I'm [Ilyas Benaissa]! 42 Intra = [ibenaiss] 👋

I am a student at [42](https://www.42.fr/) (1337 campus) with a passion for programming and software development. Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find some of the projects I've worked on during my journey at 42.

## Projects

### 1. [Libft](https://github.com/Ileyassu/42-cursus/tree/main/libft)

[Libft](https://github.com/Ileyassu/42-cursus/tree/main/libft). is my first project at 42, where I built a library of essential functions that serve as the foundation for my future projects. The library includes functions for string manipulation, memory allocation, list manipulation, and more.

### 2. [ft_printf](https://github.com/Ileyassu/42-cursus/tree/main/printf)

[ft_printf](https://github.com/Ileyassu/42-cursus/tree/main/printf). is another project where I created a customized printf function. This involved parsing format specifiers, handling various data types, and formatting the output accordingly.


### 3. [Born2beroot](https://github.com/Ileyassu/42-cursus/tree/main/Born2beroot)

[Born2beroot](https://github.com/Ileyassu/42-cursus/tree/main/Born2beroot). in this project Born2beroot is a virtualization masterpiece, where I dived deep into the world of Linux. 🐧✨ I crafted a virtual machine from scratch, handling everything from minimal installation to configuring partitions and LVM.



Feel free to explore my repositories, and I'm always open to collaboration and feedback. Happy coding! 🚀

### 4. [Get_next_line](https://github.com/Ileyassu/42-cursus/tree/main/getnextline)

[Born2beroot](https://github.com/Ileyassu/42-cursus/tree/main/getnextline). In my "Get Next Line" project, I explored the intricacies of file I/O operations, memory management, and static variables in C. 📄💻 Leveraging the open function, I obtained file descriptors and efficiently read data using read. Dynamic memory allocation with malloc ensured adaptability to varying line lengths, while free prevented memory leaks.
Static variables maintained state across function calls, contributing to the functionality of the "get next line" operation. Understanding the memory layout, particularly the Data Segment and BSS, further enriched my grasp of C programming.
