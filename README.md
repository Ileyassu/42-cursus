# Hello, I'm [Ilyas Benaissa]! 42 Intra = [ibenaiss] ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at [42](https://www.42.fr/) (1337 campus) with a passion for programming and software development. Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find some of the projects I've worked on during my journey at 42.

## Projects

### 1. [Libft](https://github.com/Ileyassu/42-cursus/tree/main/libft)

[Libft](https://github.com/Ileyassu/42-cursus/tree/main/libft). is my first project at 42, where I built a library of essential functions that serve as the foundation for my future projects. The library includes functions for string manipulation, memory allocation, list manipulation, and more.

### 2. [ft_printf](link-to-ft_printf-repo)

[ft_printf](https://github.com/Ileyassu/42-cursus/tree/main/printf). is another project where I created a customized printf function. This involved parsing format specifiers, handling various data types, and formatting the output accordingly.
